  #CHANGED see comment below
  player-max-chunk-load-rate: 100

  ## Max concurrent rate per player limits the
  ## concurrent on the server but not the total rate at which a player is
  ## loading chunks up to the point where the server is max CPU/IO if a
  ## player is travelling fast enough. Players with elytra will be
  ## travelling roughly 2 chunks per second, ice roads are faster still.
  ## This means each player can load upto 40 chunks per second while flying
  ## and can load up 314 after rtp at whatever the max rate the server can
  ## handle 20 at a time.

  ## Suggest implementing a max load rate for players, this will likely reduce issues
  ## with rtp causing huge load spikes and when flying(chunks should be loaded
  ## in a sane order closest first but not finding documentation) Added a
  ## rate per player of 100 above, this means after an rtp whole 314 area
  ## is loaded in ~3 seconds, this lines up with the send rate of 100 below
  ## so player can't load more chunks in a second than can be sent to them
  ## and is far faster than a flying player can travel under normal
  ## circumstance. Performance and effect on server will have to be
  ## judged with such a change but seems like it might help especially
  ## when under load, actual effect most of the time will likely be 0
  ## on server and a minor delay on rtp for all chunks in the distance
